Input: NETWORK as SIF-file

Step 1) Break NETWORK into individual subgraph .net files for each connected component ("ISLANDS") 
	OUTPUT A) .net files
Step 2) For each ISLAND, identify COMMUNITIES via the infoMAP algorithm. 
	OUTPUT B) .map community files
	OUTPUT C) comm_genelist.txt files
Step 3) For each COMMUNITY larger than 10 nodes, run Over-Representation Analysis on a set of functional genesets (KEGG, Gene Ontology)...also known generally as PROCESSES 
	OUTPUT D) enrichment table for each community
	OUTPUT E) Heatmap for each ISLAND
	OUTPUT F) Global NETWORK Heatmap for all enriched COMMUNITIES
	OUTPUT G) COMMUNITY-PROCESS map: a bipartite graph, with nodes representing communities, nodes representing processes, and edges with corrected p-value as weight. 
Step 4) Data tables to help visualization of information
	OUTPUT H) GENE DATA TABLE: linking each individual gene in NETWORK to a COMMUNITY 
	OUTPUT I) COMMUNITY DATA TABLE: Containing number of nodes in each COMMUNITY
	OUTPUT J) PROCESS DATA TABLE: Containing number of genes in PROCESS
